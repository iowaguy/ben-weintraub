            <h1 id="handler-motion-and-offensive-philosophy">Handler Motion and
                Offensive Philosophy</h1>
            <p>During my freshman year at Iowa, I played for the B team. Our B team
                captain once told me that the swings between handlers should resemble a
                pendulum. Back and forth. Back and forth. Swing and swing and swing
                until an opportunity opens up for an easy shot upfield. Since that crisp
                fall in 2008 when he bestowed that knowledge upon an impressionable
                freshman (me), I’ve come to believe that, strategy-wise, he was
                basically a huge idiot.</p>
            <p>In many ways, Ultimate is like chess. A good chess player does what a
                good cutter or handler does on offense—they put their opponent in
                strings of difficult situations and force them to choose one outcome or
                another. In Ultimate, the simplest and most effective way to expose
                exploitable flaws in the defense is to put your defender in a position
                where there are two viable, threatening cuts. Force the defender to make
                a decision about which cut they are going to take away. Whichever they
                choose: make the opposite cut. This is the core intuition behind our
                handler set.</p>
            <p>Broadly speaking, we are going to attack two areas: the upline space
                and the break side. If you feel that your defender has taken away one of
                those options, I guarantee you the other is open—if briefly. The only
                difficulty is timing, because if you don’t respond to the defender’s
                choice quickly enough, they will have time to recover and shut down the
                second option as well.</p>
            <p>What really allows this offense to work is one simple fact: all
                handler flows start and end from the same two arrangements. Either (a)
                the dump is on the break side, or (b) the dump is on the force side. As
                long as we finish each movement in one of these two arrangements, we
                will be able to string together threatening dump cuts as long as
                necessary.</p>

            <p>In the links below you will see a series of interactive diagrams
                explaining our handler flow in a variety of situations. While the sheer
                number of sequences (five) might feel overwhelming, I assure you that
                they are simply an enumeration of two simple principles.

                make a blow by cut, make an upfield dump cut, or make a triangle cut. Again, the dump
                should be in a position where they can threaten at least two of these

                throw?</strong></h2>
            <p>Here's a simple mnemonic: <em>“Force side follow, break side
                brake.”</em> In other words, if you swing it to the force side, go
                upline for the person you threw it to. <strong>Always always always take
                at least two hard steps</strong>. Test your defender, if they have it
                well covered or something is developing downfield, you can always cut
                your strike short—getting back in the break side dump position until the
                thrower activates you with eye contact. Here's an
                example sequence of Brown doing exactly this.</p>
            <div class="row justify-content-center">
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSzh3p74mFk?si=xx59ccsG3sxpCZN2&amp;start=287" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>If you swing to the break side and are thus now on the force side,
                chill. You are the first dump. The thrower may send it back to you at
                any time. For example if they want to go back upline immediately (<a
                                                                                      href="https://youtu.be/nUia5quPnBk?t=20">example</a>). Also, you don’t
                want to clear upfield yet, because you’ll be running right into the
                force side cutting lane (bad).</p>
            <h2 id="when-can-i-leave-the-dump-set"><strong>When can I leave the dump
                set?</strong></h2>
            <p>Never! Once a handler, always a handler. Okay okay, the real answer
                is: if you are the second dump (i.e., there is another dump in between
                you and the disc) you can go back to the stack. This will often happen
                when the other dump throws upfield to a cutter. Unlike the first dump,
                you are far enough that if you go wide you won’t cut off anything in the
                force side lane. This is not set in stone. If you’re uncomfortable in
                the dump set, you can clear whenever as long as you don’t cut off
                anything upfield.</p>
            <h2 id="my-dump-left-can-i-have-another"><strong>My dump left, can I
                have another?</strong></h2>
            <p>These options are the same regardless of the force. If the dump
                clears, then we will get our reset from the front of the stack. The
                double threat option here is that the dump cut can stop early and go
                upline (AKA “zip” cut).</p>

            <p>This is one of the more important topics we’ll discuss this season.
                Being on the same page about our resets is a potential bottleneck of our
                success. Teams that can reset the disc will buy themselves time for
                cutters to get open. And here, the analogy with chess must come to an
                end, because unlike the view of my erstwhile college captain: resets are
                not the result of mechanical swinging—unlike chess, there is no reward
                for getting to the other side. You must set up your cut deliberately.
                You must make your defender choose. If you don’t have two options, you
                have none.</p>



            <!-- <h1>Handler Motion and Offensive Philosophy</h1>

                 During my freshman year at Iowa, I played for the B team. Our B team captain once told me that the swings between handlers should resemble a pendulum. Back and forth. Back and forth. Swing and swing and swing until an opportunity opens up for an easy shot upfield. Since that crisp fall in 2008 when he bestowed that knowledge upon an impressionable freshman (me), I’ve come to believe that, strategy-wise, he was basically a huge idiot.

A good chess player does what a good cutter or handler does on offense—they put their opponent in strings of difficult situations and force them to choose one outcome or another. In Ultimate, the simplest and most effective way to expose exploitable flaws in the defense is to put your defender in a position where there are two viable, threatening cuts. Force the defender to make a decision about which cut they are going to take away. Whichever they choose: make the opposite cut. This is the core intuition behind our handler set.

                 The dump can either make a short back cut setting up the throw and go, make an upfield dump cut, or make a blow by cut. Again, the dump should be in a position where they can threaten at least two of these options.

                 <h2>What do I do after I throw?</h2>

                 I propose a simple mnemonic: <em>“Force side follow, break side brake.”</em> In other words, if you swing it to the force side, go upline for the person you threw it to. **Always always always take at least two hard steps**. Test your defender, if they have it well covered or something is developing downfield, you can always cut your strike short—getting back in the break side dump position until the thrower activates you with eye contact.

For example if they want to go back upline immediately ([example](https://youtu.be/nUia5quPnBk?t=20)). Also, you don’t want to clear upfield yet, because you’ll be running right into the force side cutting lane (bad).

                 <h2>When can I leave the dump set?</h2>

                 Never! Once a handler, always a handler. Okay okay, the real answer is: if you are the second dump (i.e., there is another dump in between you and the disc) you can go back to the stack. This will often happen when the other dump throws upfield to a cutter. Unlike the first dump, you are far enough that if you go wide you won’t cut off anything in the force side lane. This is not set in stone. If you're uncomfortable in the dump set, you can clear whenever as long as you don’t cut off anything upfield.

                 <h2>My dump left, can I have another?</h2>

                 These options are the same regardless of the force. If the dump clears, then we will get our reset from the front of the stack. The double threat option here is that the dump cut can stop early and go upline (AKA “zip” cut).

                 2. [Stack fill: zip cut](https://www.ultiplays.com/teams/64be8aa62f3c2500134aba90/games/64be9b782f3c2500134abac4?tag=64be8ae42f3c2500134aba94) ([Here’s an example](https://youtu.be/j6r1G8bw450?t=5660) of a well-executed zip cut for Team USA, \#2, note that he doesn’t get the disc but he is wide open if the thrower was looking. And another from [Oppie Payne on Fury, fast-forward to 1:00:07](https://vimeo.com/766219248)).

                 This is one of the more important topics we’ll discuss this season. Being on the same page about our resets is a potential bottleneck of our success. Teams that can reset the disc will buy themselves time for cutters to get open. And here, the analogy with chess must come to an end, because unlike the view of my erstwhile college captain: resets are not the result of mechanical swinging—unlike chess, there is no reward for getting to the other side. You must set up your cut deliberately. You must make your defender choose. If you don’t have two options, you have none. -->
